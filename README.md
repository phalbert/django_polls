# Simple app to learn django

## Motivation
I have been using flask due to its minimality and was quite hesistant to pick up Django. However, I have come to this point due to the following reasons:
- Productivity is key
- A lot of work goes into building a complex application with flask. Django has a lot of this work already done

### Templates
Your project’s TEMPLATES setting describes how Django will load and render templates. The default settings file configures a DjangoTemplates backend whose APP_DIRS option is set to True. By convention DjangoTemplates looks for a “templates” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS.
